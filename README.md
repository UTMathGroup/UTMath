## üìÑ UTMath
*UTMath: Math Evaluation with **Unit Test** via Reasoning-to-Coding Thoughts*

*UTMath is a rigorous and expansive benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with an average of 68 test cases per problem to ensure that the model **truly solves the problem** rather than simply memorizing the answers.*
<ul>
    <li><b>‚ö°Ô∏èMultiple Case Validation</b>: Instead of using single cases that can be memorized, our questions are sequence-based, allowing numerous cases for validating true understanding.</li>
    <li><b>üîßTrue Reasoning Evaluation</b>: Hard cases and runtime metrics help filter memorization and compare solution efficiency, precisely assessing reasoning abilities.</li>
</ul>

*The Reasoning-to-Coding of Thoughts (RCoT) approach complements the UTMath Benchmark by encouraging LLMs to engage in explicit reasoning prior to generating code.RCoT significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the solution.*
<ul>
    <li><b>üèÜCode Output Evaluation</b>: We require LLMs to output code, focusing on reasoning rather than direct answers, to better reflect their reasoning skills.</li>
    <li><b>üåêObservation of Reasoning Process</b>: By mandating code implementation, we can observe and validate the LLM's reasoning process, not just the final answer.</li>
</ul>


![overview](./pic/overview.png)

In `data/oeis_problem.jsonl`, you'll find all 1053 problems from the UTMath benchmark, covering 9 mathematical domains. Each problem includes over 68 test cases.

## üìä Evaluating on UTMath

You can use this sample as a reference for evaluating on UTMath. Please use the following code:
```python
python utmath_eval/utmath_evaluator.py  --problem_file=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --sample_file={your_sample_file_path}
```

For example, you can directly use our response sample:
The file `data/sample_example/gpt-4o_sample.jsonl` contains responses generated using the RCoT method with GPT-4o on the UTMath benchmark. This sample includes responses to all 1053 problems.
```python
python utmath_eval/utmath_evaluator.py  --problem_file=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --sample_file=data/sample_example/gpt-4o_sample.jsonl

# --with_extra_data=True represents testing both easy and hard cases
# --with_extra_data=None represents testing only easy cases
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è RCoT Inference
We have preconfigured the environment to use OpenAI's API to call GPT-4o and apply the RCoT method for reasoning. After setting up your API key in the environment, you can enter the following command:
```python
python get_rcot_response.py --problem_path=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --save_path={your_save_file_path} --model_name={your_llm_name}
```
For example, after setting up the OpenAI API, you can use the following Python code to call GPT-4o and perform reasoning using the RCoT method.
```python
python get_rcot_response.py --problem_path=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --save_path=data/sample_exapmle/gpt-4o_test.jsonl --model_name=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
```

## ü•á Leaderboard
- The best model, GPT-4o, only solves 26.93\% problem in our benchmark, demonstrate the difficulty of our benchmarks.

## üòé Some interesting findings
We conducted a comprehensive study with 8 LLMs. Some of our key findings are summarized as follows:

- Modern LLMs perform poorly in Graph Theory, Group Theory, Geometry and Topology.
![performance on different problemd categories](./pic/performance_on_different_problems_categories.png)

- With RCoT, 7 of 8 evaluated LLMs generated more efficient solutions, with most models achieving higher scores.
- RCoT can significantly improve the pass@k performance of LLMs.

- The quality of reasoning significantly impacts the accuracy and efficiency of the model's final solution.

We hope our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of current reasoning ability of LLMs and the further development of models.

## üëÄ Furthermore
*Additionally, we are releasing not only the UTMath benchmark but also the UTMath-Train dataset, consisting of over 70,000 problem-solving samples. This dataset is designed to support the community in further advancing research on mathematical reasoning and improving LLM performance in this domain.*
